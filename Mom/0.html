		<h1>Day 0: <del>July 25, 2016</del> June 22, 2017</h1>
		<h1 id="birthday">ðŸŽ‚HAPPY BIRTHDAY!ðŸŽ‚</h1>
		(This is still last year's birthday present.)
		<h2>Message</h2>
		<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hi Mom!</span></strong></p>
		<p>I still would like to start a daily challenge for you, but I have slightly changed it. Here is how it will now work:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I will text you when the daily challenge is ready.</li>
			<li>When you get the chance, open <a href="OldBunny2800.github.io">OldBunny2800.github.io</a> and type in your username in the box. (This is preset to "Mom", but I can change it for you if you want.) Click <kbd>Go!</kbd>.</li>
			<li>You will see all the past challenges (if you want to revisit them). The new one will be at the bottom of the page; click on it!</li>
			<li>You will have a programming challenge. I know you don't know how, just keep reading:</li>
			<br>
			The challenge will consist of:
			<ul>
				<li>Instructions. I will make sure you know all you need to know to solve the challenge.</li>
				<li>A place to write your code or answer the challenge.</li>
				<li>Dynamic feedback based on the code you wrote.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>On successful completion, you will unlock a new TED-Ed or Crash Course video handpicked by me. I'm sure you will find them very interesting.</li>
		</ol>
		If you have any questions, please find me or <a href="mailto:NoahS2003@gmail.com">email me</a>.
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>If you remember from last time, this lesson is just installing software and learning how to use the Terminal, hence being called "Day 0".</p>
		<p><b><span class="note"></span>There is no software I will ask you to download that is not completely safe for you and your computer.</b></p>
		<p>Anyway, the language I will be teaching you is called Python. It is a very beginner-friendly language, and is very versatile.
		<br>
		<span class="fyi"></span>Python is the programming language I learned in one of my Chugim (Electives) at camp!  It is also the language I used to code the rock-paper-scissors game I made a couple months ago, and my personal favorite language.</p>
		<span class="note"></span>From now on, unless I say otherwise, when I say to open a link, follow these steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Right click the link.
				<br>
				<span class="reminder"></span>On a Mac, you "right click" by clicking with two fingers.
			</li>
			<li>Click "open in a new tab".</li>
			<li>Continue to follow my instructions by switching back and forth between the repl.it tab and the link you opened.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3><span class="reminder">What you did last time:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You downloaded Sublime Text 2, a free coding text editor! This is useful because it provides syntax highlighting, which color-codes (no pun intended) your code as you write, making it easier to understand your code.</li>
			<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2329876c915e6e677c27e4dadd5708d574272eec/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f646f6d696e6963746172722f63616e7661732d70726f67726573732d6261722f6d61737465722f70726f67726573732e706e67" alt="Lesson 50% complete.">
			Everything past this point, we will review, so don't worry.
			<li>You learned how to open Terminal!</li>
			<li>You learned how to use the commands <code>open</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cd</code>.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Let's do it!</h3>
		<p>To use Python, you need to know some basic commands in the Terminal.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>First, click on your Launchpad (the rocketship in your Dock), go into the Other folder, and click Terminal. A blank screen with some text should come up.</li>
			<li>First command: <i>open</i>. In your terminal, type a line that looks like this: <code class="codeblock">Jills-MBP:~ Jill Simon$ open -a Safari</code></li>
			Don't worry if the first part doesn't look exactly like I typed, as long as it looks similar it's fine. Press enter to submit the command. If this window came up, you did it right!
			<li>Now try:<code class="codeblock">Jills-MBP:~ Jill Simon$ open -a "Sublime Text 2"</code></li>
			Did a text editor come up? If so, great!
			<br>
			<span class="note"></span>From now on, I will only type the $ and everything afterward, because everything before is done for you and doesn't really matter right now. You don't need to type the opening $ though, it's already there.
			<li>So, the <i>open</i> command <i>open</i>s things!
				<br>
				<span class="fyi"></span>What the <i>-a</i> does is specify that you're opening an application. That way, your computer doesn't have to look for some file named Sublime Text 2 or Safari. Also, I used quotes around the Sublime Text 2 so it treats it as one word, not 3. It is a concept you will learn more about tomorrow.
			</li>
			<li>Next command: <i>ls</i>. Type<code class="codeblock">$ ls</code>It should come up with a <b>l</b>i<b>s</b>t of all the files in your home folder, or ~. You should recognize some of these! What <i>ls</i> does is lists all the files and directories, or folders, in the folder you are currently in.</li>
			<li>Type<code class="codeblock">$ cd Documents</code>and press enter. Notice that the ~ at the beginning of the line changed to Documents. What the <i>cd</i> command does is <b>c</b>hanges <b>d</b>irectories on your computer. Basically, it's the same as you double-clicking on a folder in Finder: it goes into it.</li>
			<li>Type<code class="codeblock">$ mkdir Coding</code>What this did was <b>m</b>a<b>k</b>e a new <b>dir</b>ectory. Test that using <i>ls</i> the same way as step 5. The output would be everything in your Documents folder. Do you see something called Coding in there?</li>
			<li>Like in Step 6, move into the Coding directory.</li>
			<li>Last new command:<code class="codeblock">$ touch helloworld.py</code>You can see what this did if you use <i>ls</i> again. What <i>touch</i> does is create a file in the folder you are currently in.
				<br>
				<span class="fyi"></span>In these challenges, always use <i>.py</i> at the end. This tells the computer it's a <i>py</i>thon file.
			</li>
			<li>Finally, <i>open</i> can open files too. Type<code class="codeblock">$ open helloworld.py -a "Sublime Text 2".</code>The text editor should open to a blank file, but at the top of the window, you should see "helloworld.py". To break it down, you <i>open</i>ed the file we just made in the <i>-a</i>pplication Sublime Text 2, what we downloaded earlier.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Whew! That was a lot for one day. The next days will be a lot shorter, I promise. You now know how to use the terminal enough to use Python. Don't worry, I will remind you in the coming days on what to do. Anyway, your reward:</p>
