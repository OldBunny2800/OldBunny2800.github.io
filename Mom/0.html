		<h2>Message</h2>
		<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hi Mom!</span></strong></p>
		<p>I still would like to start a daily challenge for you, but I have slightly changed it. Here is how it will now work:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I will text you when the daily challenge is ready.</li>
			<li>When you get the chance, open <a href="OldBunny2800.github.io">OldBunny2800.github.io</a> and type in your username in the box. (This is preset to "Mom", but I can change it for you if you want.) Click <kbd>Go!</kbd>.</li>
			<li>You will see all the past challenges (if you want to revisit them). The new one will be at the bottom of the page; click on it!</li>
			<li>You will have a programming challenge. I know you don't know how, just keep reading:</li>
			<br>
			The challenge will consist of:
			<ul>
				<li>Instructions. I will make sure you know all you need to know to solve the challenge.</li>
				<li>A place to write your code or answer the challenge.</li>
				<li>Dynamic feedback based on the code you wrote.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>On successful completion, you will unlock a new TED-Ed or Crash Course video handpicked by me. I'm sure you will find them very interesting.</li>
		</ol>
		If you have any questions, please find me or <a href="mailto:NoahS2003@gmail.com">email me</a>.
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>If you remember from last time, this lesson is just installing software and learning how to use the Terminal, hence being called "Day 0".</p>
		<p><b><span class="note"></span>There is no software I will ask you to download that is not completely safe for you and your computer.</b></p>
		<p>Anyway, the language I will be teaching you is called Python. It is a very beginner-friendly language, and is very versatile.
		<br>
		<b><span class="fyi"></span></b>Python is the programming language I learned in one of my Chugim (Electives) at camp!  It is also the language I used to code the rock-paper-scissors game I made a couple months ago, and my personal favorite language.</p>
		<b><span class="note"></span></b>From now on, unless I say otherwise, when I say to open a link, follow these steps:
		<ol>
			<li>Right click the link. <b><span class="reminder"></span></b>On a Mac, you "right click" by clicking with two fingers.</li>
			<li>Click "open in a new tab".</li>
			<li>Continue to follow my instructions by switching back and forth between the repl.it tab and the link you opened.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3><span class="reminder">What you did last time:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You downloaded Sublime Text 2, a free coding text editor! This is useful because it provides syntax highlighting, which color-codes (no pun intended) your code as you write, making it easier to understand your code.</li>

			Everything past this point, we will review, so don't worry.
			<li>You learned how to open Terminal!</li>
			<li>You learned how to use the commands <code>open</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>cd</code>.</li>
		</ul>
